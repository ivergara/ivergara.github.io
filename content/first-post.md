Summary: Kickstarting of the blog.
Status: published

A few months ago I left academia, working as a research physicist (experimental condensed matter) and started working as a software developer. 

Here I'd want to expose some discoveries, ideas, projects, and anything else related to computing. Mostly it'll be based on python, but it might feature some other languages once I get to explore them. Otherwise, every now and then I'll try to feature some science or math oriented stuff and maybe some technology rants.

Hope to be able to produce somewhat regular content.
